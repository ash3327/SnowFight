 - Deep Q-Learning Shooter Game Project “SnowFight” [Group Project] (October - December 2022) #Python #ReinforcementLearning
   - Created a Gym environment of a simple third-person shooter game in Python
   - Led the project and planned an efficient work schedule, while collaborating closely with groupmate throughout the development
   - Implemented a simple Deep-Q Network with PyTorch to train agents to master at the game (left image)
   - Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the agent, achieving average kill streak of 7 (right image, top) and lengthend the survival duration by 4 times (right image, bottom), which significantly better than the random baseline of 0.22 kills on average.
   - Explored how deep-Q learning models handle a variable quantity of moving objects, i.e. the bullets and enemies, and relevant adjustments to the reward functions and representations of the observation space needed.
